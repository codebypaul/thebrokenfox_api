        BlueCrate.com works with manufacturers and artisans across the world to source the coolest products at the prices that suit you. 

    </p>
    <p>
        This results in all our orders being shipped to you from across the world - from Thailand and China to Morocco. However we do ensure we can track our orders for your extra piece of mind.

    </p>
    <p>
        Yet because your products are coming from so far away they often take 2-3 weeks to arrive. So no worrying if the product doesn't arrive the next day! Most of the time our product will arrive a lot quicker, but we want you to be aware this is out of our control!

        This does mean we ship worldwide, so you can shop with us wherever you are.
